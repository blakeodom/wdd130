		<h2>Blake Odom</h2>
		<p>Hi everybody! My name is Blake and I'm a Computer Science major at BYUI, currently in my freshman year. I'm from Southern California and am definitely prepared for the brutal winters here in Idaho. :)</p>
		<p>I served my mission back in 2018 in Rome, Italy and have since done some schooling in Utah and worked in California as well. I'm excited for my time here and for what my education will bring!</p>
